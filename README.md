Culminating project for my grade 10 Computer Studies class, where I had to build an open-ended project in Scratch. 
I set off to make a 3D renderer in Scratch with no previous experience or knowledge of math beyond simple functions. 

Here is the project link: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/927703353

And here is an early version: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/790694181/

The project took two months to complete, as I had little project experience and did not plan.
I learned an incredible amount making this project, and while the 3d system is incredibly crude and hacked together and does not allow for, say, changing the field of view, it marks the first time I set out to make a project and ended up with a useable thing.
